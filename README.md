# Green-Team

## Setup:
- Create new python virtual environment (I am using python version 3.11.5)
    - I named mine .venv and added it to the gitignore so its not on the repo
- run: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - This will install Django and all the necessary dependencies
- run: cd frontend/clubscheduler-fronted && npm install
    - This will install the node modules for the react project
 
This should be enough to get the basic project structure set up, but I may have missed someting \- Donny
